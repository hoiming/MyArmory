This directory was prepared by forum user, "picobit", and reviewed by the ATI
team.  These notes describe what had to be done on fresh installs of OS X
10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and 10.9 (Mavericks) in order to get
build-app.py working.

(1) Install xcode from the Apple store (free)

(2) From within xcode, install the command-line utilities
    "Xcode" --> "Preferences" --> "Downloads"

(3) You may also have to run "xcode-select --install" from the terminal.
    You will have to click through an EULA and a few other dialogs.

(4) From Red Emerald's preparation steps for compiling Armory on Mac
    (https://gist.github.com/WyseNynja/4200620), execute the following
    to install and update brew:

       $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
       $ touch ~/.bashrc
       $ echo "export CFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\"" >> ~/.bashrc
       $ echo "export ARCHFLAGS=\"-arch x86_64\"" >> ~/.bashrc
       $ source ~/.bashrc
       $ brew update
       $ brew doctor

(5) Execute "brew install swig"

(6) "cd" into the "osxbuild" directory, and execute "python build-app.py".
    Armory will be found under the "workspace" subdirectory. Armory.app can be
    moved elsewhere on the system, including under /Applications so that it's
    accessible by the OS X Launchpad.
